Create a class named Person where the class will have 
properties name(string), height(float) and age(int). Make
 a constructor and create a dynamic object of that class and
  finally pass proper values using the constructor. 
  
  Create two objects of the Person class from question 
  2-c and initialize them with proper value. Now compare
   whose age is greater, and print his/her name.
